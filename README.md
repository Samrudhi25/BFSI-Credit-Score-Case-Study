# BFSI-Credit-Score-Case-Study
Problem Statement

SmartLend is a financial institution that understands credit risk is inherent in banking. As you understood just now, credit risk simply refers to the possibility that payments may be made late or not at all, which may result in cash flow issues and may impact a bank’s liquidity. Despite advancements in the financial services industry, credit risk continues to be the key factor in bank failures. In most cases, this part of risk management accounts for more than 70% of a bank’s balance sheet. Therefore, it is imperative for any financial institution to determine customers’ credit scores and SmartLend is no exception.

The primary objective of this project is thus helping SmartLend to divide its customers into different credit score brackets based on their demographic and past transactions data.
